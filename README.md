Solutions to Project Euler

This repo is meant to hold the solutions to the problems present in the Project Euler archives.
I hope to solve two-three problems each week, with an ultimate aim to be able to post solutions to a new problem every other day("hope").
Will try using different programming languages, but predominantly Ruby. This activity is meant to keep me on my toes to learn a new language, and to keep me mentally active. Again, this is the ideal case scenario, we'll see where this ends up, will try my best to keep up.

Cheers!!

Problem 1:
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find teh sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
